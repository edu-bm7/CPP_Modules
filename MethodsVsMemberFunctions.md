# Methods vs Member Functions in C++

In C++, member functions are functions defined within a class and associated with instances of that class. These functions can access and manipulate the data members of the class. Member functions that are declared with the static keyword belong to the class itself rather than any particular object and are called static member functions. Static member functions do not have access to the this pointer and can only access static data members of the class.

Methods, on the other hand, specifically refer to member functions that are declared as virtual. Virtual methods enable dynamic linkage, meaning their behavior can be overridden by derived classes and determined at runtime, supporting polymorphism.
